This test exposes a problem in the handling of PATH_INFO in C::Engine::CGI (and
other engines) where Catalyst does not un-escape the request correctly.
If a request is URL-encoded then Catalyst fails to decode the request
and thus will try and match actions using the URL-encoded value.

Can NOT use Catalyst::Test as it uses HTTP::Request::AsCGI which does
correctly unescape the path (by calling $uri = $uri->canonical).

This will fix the problem for the CGI engine, but is probably the
wrong place.  And also does not fix $uri->base, either.

Plus, the same issue is in Engine::Apache* and other engines.
